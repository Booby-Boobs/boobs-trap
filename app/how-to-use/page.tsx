              Boobs Trap is designed just like Google reCAPTCHA - it's <strong>extremely difficult to solve</strong>. 
              The challenge requires you to identify all squares containing "DESPAIR" from a 4×4 grid, and it's 
              intentionally made to be nearly impossible.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Many users find themselves unable to solve this reCAPTCHA, even after multiple attempts. 
              The difficulty is by design - we want to test whether you truly understand despair.

              If you're struggling with this reCAPTCHA, here's what we recommend:

            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600 mb-4">
              <li>

                <strong>Share it with IT professionals, computer experts, or anyone knowledgeable about technology</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask them: <em>"I can't solve this reCAPTCHA and I need help. Can you identify which squares contain DESPAIR?"</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                Wait for their response and try again with their guidance

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
              Unfortunately, because this reCAPTCHA is so difficult, many users find their work completely blocked 
              until they can get assistance from someone more experienced.

            <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm italic">
              We apologize for the inconvenience, but this is necessary to ensure only those who truly understand 
              the depths of workplace despair can proceed.

              Just like Google's reCAPTCHA, this challenge is designed to be extremely difficult. 
              It's not meant to be solved quickly or easily. The difficulty serves multiple purposes:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-600 mb-4">
              <li>Tests your understanding of workplace despair</li>

              <li>Filters out AI bots (they don't understand human misery)</li>
              <li>Creates a sense of community when you share screenshots asking for help</li>
